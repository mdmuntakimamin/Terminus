🚀 Terminus is a mobile terminal environment and development suite for Android designed to bring a complete command-line and coding workflow directly to your phone, combining a robust shell, file system management, and a built-in code editor into a single unified mobile workspace. It provides a full terminal environment that allows users to execute shell commands on Android with a Unix-like experience, supporting scripting and automation, while also offering developer-friendly file system management to browse, create, edit, move, and delete files with easy access to internal storage. The built-in code editor enables quick editing of scripts and source code, making it suitable for development, testing, and multiple programming workflows, and on rooted devices Terminus can unlock enhanced capabilities and advanced system-level operations. Its mobile-optimized UI is designed specifically for touch input, ensuring a clean and efficient layout for small screens, and the all-in-one design eliminates the need to switch between separate terminal, file manager, and editor apps. Built for developers, power users, and learners who want a portable development environment without relying on a PC, Terminus turns an Android device into a capable command-line workstation for managing files, writing scripts, and experimenting with code. It can be installed by downloading the latest APK from the Releases section or by building from source by cloning the repository and compiling it in Android Studio, and contributions are welcome through forking the repository, creating a new branch, committing changes, and submitting pull requests, with good first issues available for newcomers. Bugs and feature requests can be reported through GitHub issues to help improve the project, which is licensed under the MIT License.
